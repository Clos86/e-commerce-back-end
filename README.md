  ![Github licence](http://img.shields.io/badge/license-ISC-blue.svg)  
  ## Description 
  I build the back end for an e-commerce site. I took a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  ## Installation 
  The application requires NodeJS and MySQL. Run ```npm instal``` and download all the dependencies. Connect to your MySQL and run ```source db/schema.sql``` to create the database and then quit out of MySQL.  In the server.js file look for ```sequelize.sync({ force: false })``` and change ```false``` to ```true```. In the command line run ```npm run seed``` then change ```force``` back to ```false```. Once that is all set you can run the app with ```npm start```.
